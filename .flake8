# We ignore the following PEP-8 styles:

# E203  whitespace before ‘:’
# E266  too many leading ‘#’ for block comment
# E402  module level import not at top of file
# E501  line too long (82 > 79 characters) (^)
# W503  line break occurred before a binary operator
# W605  invalid escape sequence (causes false alarms around regex)

# Note: (^) These checks can be disabled at the
# line level using the # noqa special comment.
# This possibility should be reserved for special cases.
