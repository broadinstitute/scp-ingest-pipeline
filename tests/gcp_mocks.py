"""Mocks for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services

These mocks enable tests to run in a manner that is fast and isolated.
GCP aspires to provide "emulators" for these services; see 
https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python/issues/4840.
Until those are available, custom mocks like these are the best available
alternative to enable integration tests to run quickly.
