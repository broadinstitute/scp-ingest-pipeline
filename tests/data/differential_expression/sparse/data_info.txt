Data for sparsemini test case derived from production SCP1711
https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP1711
Relevant data for integration test copied to staging SCP295
https://singlecell-staging.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP295

SCP1711 has mtx for raw counts but not barcode or feature files uploaded
dimensions of processed count mtx match raw count dims
calcuation of DE on raw count mtx using processed count feature and barcode files
produced results that identify published marker genes as DE genes - used as confirmation
that feature and barcode files apply to both mtx files.

To generate the sparsemini dataset, the raw mtx file was sorted by gene
using sort_sparse_matrix.py (can be found in script directory)
MTX truncated to only have data for 2 genes
feature file edited to 2 genes
MTX dimensions row edited to match truncated data
